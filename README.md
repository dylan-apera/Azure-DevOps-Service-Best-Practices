# Azure DevOps Services Best Practices

This repository is a collection of users experience of Azure DevOps primarily focused on the governance and management of the platform. Through my experiences working with large enterprise customers I hope to bring to light some of the common challenges that organisations face when using the platform. 


_Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft but do not provide this documentation on behalf of Microsoft. As there is a gap in documentation I hope to use this repository to create a set of best practices that you can leverage if you are considering to scale this platform our to other users._
